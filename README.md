# Weekly Updates
## 8/27-9/2
Environment and website set up (downloading android studio and setting up this blog page). Schedule and milestones is in progress and will carry into the next week. UI development will occur in android studio and database management/display of data will occur on a website. Designs and tutorials are more important at the moment. This week has mostly consisted of setup and keeping up with my other classes.

## 9/3-9/9
I've made a both vague and detailed schedule for myself as well as milestones for sections of my work. The schedule consists of a monthly schedule, so for September I'll be focusing on planning/design and learning the necessary topics (mobile, looking at API's). For now I've separated my milestones into design, implementation, and thesis, as each are topics I feel I'll be working on in parallel. Overall, my prospective schedule means I'll have two to three months for planning and design, and three months for implementation and testing. When I had some downtime I looked into database tutorials as I'm considering the possibility of its use.

## 9/10-9/16
This week I was limited in what I had time for due to getting behind in two days worth of classes as a result of career fair. I was able to sketch out some general UML diagrams before realizing that I didn't really know what my users would want specifically so I tried to make some time to go through some websites of local medical facilities and get a feel for what I would look for. Then I started making plans for how I wanted to get user input. I'm thinking a survey listing what I've thought of and having an option for survey takers to add their own desires. 

## 9/17-9/23
This week I was able to explore the Google Maps API, and consider UI functionality through some UI wireframes. I also put out a survey to potential users to make sure I will design the mobile app in a way that will incorporate desired information. Of the most recent look, the initial preferences of having the services provided, insurances accepted, location, and more are most popular. However, added suggestions include patient reviews from rating services, phone numbers, prices, and more. Finally I've been trying to go through Android Studio's tutorials for building an app.
